- <span style="font-size: 24px;"> The screen was held in shape by gluing it to a using a custom fabricated acrylic “hull” that could be placed over the subject’s head and guided into the bore with them.

    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The original back brace cast an unwanted shadow and was replaced with the lower profile one shown floating in front. A new back bracket, consistent with this design, has been added to the dxf file. </span>

## **Materials**
- <span style="font-size: 24px;"> Screen Sheet (not shown): [polystyrene](https://www.mcmaster.com/8734K39/)</span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Any material is fine. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> We found some plastics had a green fluorescence when illuminated by the projector. Polystyrene did not, resulted in a reasonably crisp image and was easily glued to the hull ribs. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 24px;"> Screen Hull: white acrylic 1/4'' (6mm)</span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Any non-magnetic material can work. We chose acrylic becasue it was easy to iterate prototypes with our laser cutter. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 24px;"> Plastic Rod: 1/4' [polystyrene rod](https://www.mcmaster.com/8720K32/) </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The rod is passed through hull ribs to maintain spacing and enforce rigidity. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Any plastic should be fine. </span>
- <span style="font-size: 24px;"> Glue: acrylic solvent (Weld-On #3 or #16)</span>
- <span style="font-size: 24px;"> Adjustable "legs": attached with 1/4''-20 nylon screws </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Hull is tapped. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The legs slot into the MRI bed. </span>
