### Materials
- Screen Hull: white acrylic 1/4'' (6mm)
    - Any non-magnetic material can work. We chose acrylic becasue it was easy to iterate prototypes with our laser cutter.
- Plastic Rod: 1/4'
    - The rod is passed through hull ribs to maintain spacing and enforce rigidity.
    - Any plastic should be fine. https://www.mcmaster.com/8720K32/ 
- Glue: acrylic solvent (Weld-On #3 or #16)
